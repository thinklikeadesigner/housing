### A few notes:
- I've incorporated the design from the new assignment into the original project with the filters and pagination, the data is from the original assignment.
- You'll notice I've added some unit tests for the filter features in unit.test.ts with Jest.

### If I had more time:
- I would like to fix clicking outside the dropdowns to close them. Or closing on selection. 
- User is taken to the last page that has results if the current page has no results.
- Removing properties from list if there are no units available, this works for search and amenities but not range yet.

## I'll be working on these bugs, so they might be fixed by the time you review the project.
