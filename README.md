A few notes:
I've incorporated the design from the new assignment into the original project with the filters and pagination, the data is from the original assignment.
You'll notice I've added some unit tests for the filter features in unit.test.ts with Jest.

If I had more time:
I would like to fix clicking outside the dropdowns to close them. Or closing on selection. 
User is taken to the last page that has results if the current page has no results.
Removing properties from list if there are no units available, this works for search and amenities but not range yet.

I'll be working on these bugs, so they might be fixed by the time you review the project.
